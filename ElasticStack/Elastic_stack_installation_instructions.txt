*********************** How to install & start Elastic-search? ***********************

Download the latest windows zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

Extract the zip file at C:\elastic-stack\

Add below properties inside /config/elasticsearch.yml

	xpack.security.enabled: true

	xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: true

Delete the 'elasticsearch' directory if exists from C:\Users\%USER_ID%\AppData\Local\Temp. This step is run only 
once i.e. during installation time only.

cd C:\elastic-stack\elasticsearch-8.8.0\bin

Run "elasticsearch.bat"

Wait for few mins so that Elastic search service will be started properly. It will display the generated password for
 the user 'elastic'. Copy that password & save it in your backup file.

Now, run "localhost:9200" inside browser.

Enter username & password as (elastic/generated_password). You should get elastic service details in JSON format inside
 browser. It completes the Elastic Search installation.

 

 

*********************** How to install & start Kibana? ***********************

Download the latest windows zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana

Extract the zip file at C:\elastic-stack\

Edit kibana.yml & uncomment below properties:

server.port: 5601

elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

In order to access Elasticsearch from Kibana, we need to generate service token using elasticsearch service with below 
command executed on elastic search bin directory.

elasticsearch-service-tokens create elastic/kibana my-token

Copy the newly generated token & add it inside kibana.yml as shown below:

elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken: "paste_generated_token_here"

Start the Kibana service using kibana.bat file. You need to wait for 3/4 minutes to start the Kibana service first time.

Now, you can hit localhost:5601 & login with the user 'elastic'. If the login is successful, it means Kibana is installed properly.
